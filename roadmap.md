NEXT STEPS:

- get the twitchsignupservice tested along with signupcontroller
- have our jwt expire the same time that the refresh token expires (or figure out what we need to do here exactly)
- test oauth flow manually
- make sure the channel point gets created (I have a feeling this isn't going to work so figure this out first)
- update SF client to force sign in to twitch, as well as being able to know if the sign in flow needs to happen again because the jwt expired
