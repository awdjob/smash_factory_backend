## Client off/unavailable functionality
 - add a column on streamer for "itemsEnabled"
 - check if itemsEnabled is toggled on/off for a streamer and respond appropriately in the controller when trying to redeem token


NEXT STEPS:

finish getting tokensControllerTest all passing - currently getting an error on the one uncommented out test for the redeem block for items not being enabled but we are setting it to enabled? not sure what the shit is going on there
